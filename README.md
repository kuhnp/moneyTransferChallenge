# Additional questions
1.
I decided to develop a single screen application for this challenge. The user first see the splash screen (the available currencies are retrieved) and then enter in the main activity.
The user can change the selected contact at any time by pressing the floating button or the selected contact image.
The main Activity contains a Fragment that embed the main views for converting the money. So this component is independant and could be easily reused.
I also added the possibility to choose the received amount of money, so that the app can find how much the user must send.


2.
I used several design patterns in the past:
  * Adapter
  * Singleton
  * Renderer
  * Observer
  * Factory
  * Model-View-Presenter (architectural pattern)
  

3.
Android developer website is very good. You can find lots of training and good practices for app development and design.
For questions, I recommend StackOverFlow which has a huge amount of questions-answers.


4.
I am reading news from Google developer blog, and I am also following several website like Android Central, Reddit, Quora.
I also watch lots of video on Youtube (tutorials, conferences, Google I/O).
